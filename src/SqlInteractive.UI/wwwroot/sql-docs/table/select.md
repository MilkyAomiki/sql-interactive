# SELECT statement

The `SELECT` statement is used to select data from a database.

The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

``` sql
SELECT Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

Here, `column1, column2, ...` are the field names of the table you want to select data from.

If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
